class MovementController:
    '''
    This is a basic application controller backend for the `qdlmove` application.
    In its current implementation, it manages calls to move or step the various 
    hardware by reference to their name as stored in the `self.positioners` dict.
    
    In the future, if more features are desired of the `qdlmove` application, 
    for example recording/saving of positions, plotting points, etc. the developer
    should add these features into this class and update the GUI/main application
    to trigger methods or store data in this class.
