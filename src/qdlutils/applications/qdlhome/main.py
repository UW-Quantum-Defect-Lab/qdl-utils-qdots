class HomeApplication:
    '''
    This is the base application for qdlhome.

    It serves as basic lanucher for each of the different applications. Note that there
    are no special protections coded into the application to prevent user error due to 
    improper usage (e.g. attempting to set the same DAQ output in two different apps
    simultaneously). This is not programmed in directly since how each app handles the
    hardware is slightly different and was not intended to be shared between multiple
    apps at the same time. Nevertheless, the applications are generally designed not to
    hold onto the hardware unecessarily and so interleaved calls are generally 
    permissible --- and improper calls should generally just throw errors (although it
    might do weird things if you're in the middle of a scan, for example).

    This application is a later addition to the qdlutils package and the individual
    apps were not initially designed to be operated in this way. Thus some bugs are
    inevitable. Please post an issue to the github page if you encounter any unusual
    interactions. 
     
    If you want to add new applications to this launcher, ensure that the structure of
    the relevant application is appropritate (able to run as the root tk.Tk, or as a 
    tk.Toplevel).

    If you wish to include additional controls in this app specifically (such as simple
    DAQ controls to flip optical components or toggle hardware), then you should separate
    this script into the standard main/application_controller/application_gui structure
    of the other applications.
