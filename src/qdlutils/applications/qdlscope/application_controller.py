        This method reads out the counts quasi-continuously. 
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        sample_time : float
            The time in seconds per sample on the DAQ board. The DAQ will be progrmamed
            to sample the counter for sample_time seconds. Note that the actual time
            between samples will be slightly larger due to computational overhead; see
            the Notes section below.
        get_rate : bool
            If `True` (default behavior), the return value will be the count rate
            (determined by the sample_time input -- not the DAQ timing! See the Notes).
            On the other hand, if `False` then the counts over each samples are instead
            returned.

        Yields
        ------
        float
            The count rate (or raw number of counts) measured over `sample_time` seconds,
            repeating until the internal `self.running` flag is set to `False`.
        
        Notes
        -----
        The specific timing of the samples will vary slightly from the predicted rate of
        1/sample_time as there is some computational overhead involved with the sampling
        itself (computations before/after the actual sampling, etc.) As a result, this
        method may return slightly incorrectly timed data, especially over long periods
        of time where the small errors (likely < 0.1%) can accumulate.

        To deal with this issue, we provide a class attribute `self.readout_time`, which
        measures (in seconds using the python `time` module) the length of time between
        the start and end of the sampling. While this in and of itself may be slightly
        inaccurate, you can use this to correct for the accumulated errors over long time
        periods. Such correction is not implemented directly into this method, however.

        Also note that the normalization of the counts (to get the count rate) uses the
        provided `sample_time` parameter and does not use the DAQ "num_samples" output.
        As a consequence, the actual DAQ sample time might vary slightly due to dropped 
        samples (see the documentation for 
            qdlutils.hardware.nidaq.coutners.NidaqBatchedRateCounter
        for more information), however dropped samples are rare and typically do not 
        correspond to any meaningful time difference (< 10 μs).

        '''
        This method reads out counts in discrete batches of length `batch_time` in
        seconds. This is useful in cases where the precise timing of the individual 
        count samples in relation to each other is important. Recall that the
        `self.read_counts_continuous()` method suffers from a slightly decreased sample
        rate due (compared to the theoretical `1/sample_time` rate) to the overhead of 
        communicating with the DAQ and passing data around.

        This method works around this issue by scheduling readout of a set number of
        samples sequentially and only handing data off to the software after each "batch"
        lasting `batch_time` seconds long. This way, the overhead time cost only occurs
        after each batch and so the timing between samples is preserved with in the
        batch. Use this method if the exact timing between data points is important.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample_time : float
            The time in seconds per sample on the DAQ board. Each data point in the 
            output will correspond to this many seconds long.
        batch_time : float
            The length of time in seconds that samples are acquired over. Timing between
            batches is not guaranteed as it depends on the computational overhead.
        get_rate : bool
            If `True` (default behavior), the return value will be the count rate.

        Yields
        ------
        np.ndarray
            A vector of the counts/count rate as a function of time over the batch.
