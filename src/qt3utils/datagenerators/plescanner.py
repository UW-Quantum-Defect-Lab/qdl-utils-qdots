class PleScanner:
    '''
    Base class with basic scanning PLE functionality. 

    Current PLE implementation consists of sequential "fast" scans by sweeping
    the laser frequency via the `wavelength_controller` agrument while simultaneously
    reading in data via the DAQ (or other generic input source) via the initialization
    argument `readers`.
        Currently only a basic DAQ reader is implemented. Additional readers for 
        simultaneous processing will require additional development at this time.

        This function configures the PleScanner scan properties.

        A single scan consists of sweeping the voltage from `min` -> `max` 
        -> `min` collecting data at `n_pixels_up` points on the `min` -> `max`
        upsweep and then `n_pixels_down` points on the `max` -> `min` downsweep.
        The upsweep and downsweep are performed in `time_up` and `time_down`
        seconds respectively which need not be equal nor correspond to the same
        voltage-per-pixel rate.
        Scans are repeated up to `n_scans` times.

        Within each pixel, the voltage is swept over `n_subpixels` intermidate
        points to ensure roughly continuous scanning of the voltage frequency.
        Data at the intermediate points are binned (summed together) and the
        resulting value is representative of the corresponding point at the start
        of the bin window.
        By convention, `n_subpixels` = 1 corresponds to no sub-pixel scanning
        because the number of samples per pixel is 1.

        Step sizes (going both up or down) are calculated

            step_size = (end - start) / n_pixels

        And the voltages are swept along points defined by

            >> np.arange(start, end, step_size)

        When the number of subpixels `n_subpixels` is greater than 1, the voltage 
        is swept in step sizes

            sub_step_size = (end - start) / (n_pixels * n_subpixels)

        with counts integrated in `n_subpixels` sized bins.


        
        As an example, suppose we have the following inputs
                min: 0, 
                max: 1, 
                n_pixels_up: 4, 
                n_pixels_down: 2, 
                n_subpixels: 2
        The data ont he upsweep is associated to points spaced by 

            step_size = (1 - 0) / 4 = 0.25

        and is taken at the subpixels with voltages spaced by

            sub_step_size = (1 - 0) / (4 * 2) = 0.125
            
        Thus, we have on the upsweep:
            Data associated to: [0,        0.25,         0.50, 0.75]
                                |          |             |
            Data recorded at  : [0, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, ...]       
                ^ 
                (Note: these are the subpixel samples)
            
        A similar set of calcuations for the down sweep yield
            Data associated to: [1,       0.5       ]
                                |         |            
            Data recorded at  : [1, 0.75, 0.50, 0.25]
            


        Why is data taken this way?
            Ideally, the subpixels should be centered around the associated voltage value, 
            however when the voltages are at the extrema this would cause values to be probed
            outside of the allowable voltage ranges. Sampling data in this manner allows one
            the sub-pixel scanning to be done in a self-consistent manner.

            One could attempt to "re-center" the pixels by shifting their associated voltages
            to the center of the subpixel (i.e. by adding `step_size/2`) but this will not 
            change the actual shape of the curve. This shift might be confusing to an
            unfamiliar user, and would be incorrect for `n_subpixels` = 0, so we opt for
            the current sampling method.
            Note that "re-centering" of the pixel may be important in cases where the voltage
            samples are replaced by frequencies (e.g. in wavemeter-assisted PLE) but in such
            cases sub-pixel scanning should probably be disabled.

            While it would appear that the voltage never actually reaches the "end" value on
            either the up/down sweep, the start of the next down/up will move the voltage to
            that value so that the overall voltage curve is continuous and has no duplicates.
            Note that, in practice, the number of pixels on a scan should be sufficient to
            resolve the signal features independent of the subpixel scanning.

        '''
        Basic implementation of a repump pulse using the analog voltage output
        of nidaq to switch a laser through an AOM.

        Current implementation expects an entry in the `self.extra_controllers`
        dictionary with key 'repump' that is of class 
        `qt3ple.nidaq.customcontrollers.ArbitraryDAQVoltageController`

        The `min_voltage` and `max_voltage` attributes define the off/on voltages
        of the repump laser respectively. Polarity can be swapped by modifying 
        the code directly. Timing is controlled by the imprecise time module.

        Generic modifications to the PLE code should implement functions of this
        type with reference to specific entries in the `extra_controllers` dict.
